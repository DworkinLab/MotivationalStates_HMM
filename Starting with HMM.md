To get started with Hidden markov models, there are a few good basic overviews.

## Overview of HMMs
###Some random resources I found on the intertube

1. I think these may be the best set of intro slides to HMMs (http://cs.au.dk/~cstorm/courses/MLiB_f13/slides/)
2. A nice intro (http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/hidden-markov-models-hmm.html)
3. An intro to some HMMs in R (http://a-little-book-of-r-for-bioinformatics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/src/chapter10.html)


###Papers related to using HMMs for the analysis of behavioural sequences

###Papers using random effects HMM

## HMM tools (Python or R)
