MotivationalStates_HMM
======================

This is just a stub for the moment. Needs editing

Repository for the BEACON funded (2014-2015) project to utilize both Avida and biological systems (bees and Drosophila) to examine the degree to which HMM can capture true underlying motivational states from observed behavioral states and transitions among states.

This project has multiple inter-connected parts. An overview can be seen here in the project proposal (add link)

1 - Using Avida to assess HMM estimation with underlying execution of operations

2 - Using food status in Bees to examinine motivational states related to foraging, hunger and satiation.

3 - Using predators to assess motivational states in Drosophila relating to vigilance.

4 - Using data from 1-3 to assess how random effect HMM do at capturing individual variation (personality?) in motivation. Prototyping random effects HMM in STAN.
